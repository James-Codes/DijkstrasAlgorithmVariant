# DijkstrasAlgorithmVariant
This program reads in a weighted graph and uses a variety of data structures and a variant of Dijkstra's algorithm to compute shortest paths. It was one of my assignments for the class Data Structures and Algorithms. See the attached [Project_Specifications.pdf](https://github.com/James-Codes/DijkstrasAlgorithmVariant/files/6957226/Project_Specifications.pdf)
PDF "Project_Specifications" for the exact details of the project.
